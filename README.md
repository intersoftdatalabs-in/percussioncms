## What is Percussion CMS?
Percussion CMS is the next generation of Percussion Software's proprietary Rhythmyx and CM1 content management products.  The original headless CMS (1999), Percussion CMS has a long history of de-coupled deployments wth easily extensible integration points for delivering content in different formats to different channels.

Our goal is to empower the developer and the marketer. Smart architecture, smart API's, smart UI. 

##  What can I do with it?

* Create and manage one or more web sites - small or large.
* Re-purpose Website content to database or XML channels.
* Implement a Java interface and publish content to any channel.
* Get folks adding content to your site or channels, all controlled by powerful workflows and permissions.
