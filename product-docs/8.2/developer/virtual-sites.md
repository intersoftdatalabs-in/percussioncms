# Virtual Sites

**Virtual Sites** are Sites whose content originates outside the traditional Percussion content
repository. Phase 1 delivers a **Git / filesystem** adapter aimed at product documentation.

## Goals

- Keep Git as the system of record for documentation (PR review, lockstep with product changes).
- Use Percussion assemblers as the site generator (Markdown → HTML).
- Provide stable page identities (`frontmatter.id`) for lightweight link checks / participants.
- Leave the door open for future adapters (SQL, API, object storage) without renaming Site → Channel.

## Source tree contract

Repository root:

```text
product-docs/
  _config.yaml
  _theme/
  assets/
  8.2/
    index.md
    getting-started/
    admin/
    developer/
    reference/
```

- Folder structure drives navigation hierarchy.
- `index.md` is the landing page for a section.
- One top-level folder per documentation version (for example `8.2/`).

## Stable identity

Every Markdown page requires YAML frontmatter with a unique **`id`** within the version.
Paths may change; `id` should not. Cross-page links use stable id links:

```markdown
See [Installation](id:install-overview).
```

Details: [Frontmatter reference](id:reference-frontmatter).

## Virtual participant registry lifetime

During a Virtual Site build, each page’s frontmatter **`id`** is registered against its published
HTML path in the **virtual participant registry** (`IPSVirtualParticipantService`). Phase 1 does
**not** create CMS content IDs or `PSX_MANAGEDLINK` rows.

| Mode | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| **Process-scoped (default)** | Registrations live in memory until the process exits, or until `clear(siteKey)` / `clearAll()` is called (SPI reset API). Unit tests and one-shot builds use this mode when no store directory is supplied. |
| **Path-backed (optional)** | Construct the registry with a portable `java.nio.file.Path` base (CLI uses `outputRoot/_meta`). Existing `participants-<siteKey>.jsonl` files are loaded on construct; `flush(siteKey)` rewrites that site’s file. Survives JVM restart when the same Path base is reused. |
| **Full rebuild** | A complete site build **clears** that site key, then upserts every discovered page, then flushes. A second build therefore does not keep pages removed from the source tree, and does not lose current ids. |

Operators can treat the JSONL under the build meta directory as a diagnostic dump of stable ids after
an offline docs build. The registry is **not** a substitute for Git as the system of record.

## Site properties (CMS)

When a Percussion Site is configured as virtual (Phase 1 property contract — no new `RXSITES`
columns), set these Site properties. The server helper
`com.percussion.services.virtualsite.PSVirtualSiteHelper` validates the contract before a Site is
treated as a safe Virtual Site source.

| Property | Required | Example | Meaning |
|----------|----------|---------|---------|
| `virtual.sourceKind` | Yes (for Virtual) | `git-filesystem` | Adapter wire name. **Allow-list (Phase 1):** `git-filesystem` only. Blank or `repository` ⇒ traditional repository Site. Unknown values are rejected. |
| `virtual.rootPath` | Yes (when virtual) | absolute path to `product-docs` (or install-relative) | Filesystem root of the Virtual Site tree. Non-blank required when virtual. Resolved with NIO `Path` (cross-platform). |
| `virtual.configFile` | No | `_config.yaml` | Config file name under the root; default `_config.yaml`. Must be a simple file name (no path separators or `..`). |
| `virtual.siteKey` | No | `product-docs` | Participant registry key; default = Site name, else `default`. |

Empty / missing `virtual.sourceKind` (or value `repository`) means a traditional repository Site.

### Validation rules

- **Source kind allow-list** — only registered adapter wire names are accepted for Virtual Sites
  (Phase 1: `git-filesystem`). Values such as future `sql` / `api` kinds are rejected until
  implemented.
- **Required root** — when `virtual.sourceKind` is virtual, `virtual.rootPath` must be non-blank.
- **Safe paths** — `virtual.rootPath` is normalized with `java.nio.file.Path`. After normalize, empty
  paths and any remaining `..` segments are rejected (path traversal). Prefer absolute paths on
  Windows (`C:\…`) and Unix (`/opt/…`); relative paths under the install are allowed when they do not
  escape via `..`.
- **Config file name** — when set, `virtual.configFile` must not contain `/`, `\`, or `..`.

## Offline build

From the repository root (after the `system` module can compile):

```bat
scripts\build-cms-docs.bat
```

```bash
scripts/build-cms-docs.sh
```

Default output: `tmp/product-docs-site/`. The build fails non-zero when internal `id:` or relative
Markdown links cannot be resolved.

## What is not in Phase 1

- CMS UI editing of Virtual items as normal content types
- Automatic migration of the full legacy help site
- SQL/API adapters
- Fake classic content-list generators for virtual items
