# REST API

Percussion CMS exposes a public **REST** surface for product integrations and modern UI clients.

## Module layout

| Module | Responsibility |
|--------|----------------|
| **`rest`** | JAX-RS resources, wire DTOs, `IXxxAdaptor` interfaces, OpenAPI generation inputs |
| **`projects/sitemanage`** | Thin `com.percussion.apibridge` implementations of those interfaces |
| **`system`** | Core services, objectstore, assembly, design backends |

Do **not** reverse the dependency: `rest` never depends on `sitemanage`.

## OpenAPI / exploration

- OpenAPI artifacts are generated from JAX-RS annotations (see `modules/perc-openapi-generator-plugin`).
- A Swagger UI webapp module packages interactive exploration for supported deployments.

Prefer the generated contract as the integration source of truth rather than reverse-engineering
UI traffic alone.

## Auth and clients

- REST calls require the authentication mode configured for the server (session/cookie or token
  patterns depending on surface and deployment).
- Treat credentials and tokens as secrets; never commit them to Git or product-docs examples.

## Workbench-replacement APIs

Developer-module (Workbench replacement) endpoints should map design operations through clean REST
+ adaptors to the same design/system capabilities classic tools used — not ad-hoc sitemanage
endpoints chosen only because they “look REST.” See repository
`docs/developer-module/workbench-rest-and-qa-modes.md` for the engineering contract.

## Content types (design catalog)

| Operation | Path | Notes |
|-----------|------|--------|
| List | `GET /services/contenttypes` | Name, label, description, guid |
| Detail | `GET /services/contenttypes/{idOrName}` | Field catalog, associations, `designGaps` |

### Field rule expressions (read-only)

Content type **detail** field rows include boolean rule **flags** and, when rules exist,
human-readable **expression summaries**:

| Field | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `hasValidation` / `validationExpression` | Validation rules present / summary of conditionals or extension calls |
| `hasVisibilityRules` / `visibilityExpression` | Visibility rules present / summary |
| `hasInputTranslation` / `inputTranslationExpression` | Input transform present / extension call summary |
| `hasOutputTranslation` / `outputTranslationExpression` | Output transform present / extension call summary |
| `control` | Display control name |
| `controlPropertyNames` | Control parameter **names** only (values and full choice catalogs not exposed) |

These expression fields are **null/omitted when empty** (`NON_NULL` JSON). They are **not**
writable via `PUT` — rule write/save and full control property editors remain Workbench /
future design APIs. `designGaps` on detail still calls out write and catalog gaps.

## Testing tips

- Unit-test resources with Mockito and provide Spring test stubs for new adaptor interfaces on the
  rest test classpath.
- Exercise adaptor implementations in sitemanage tests.
- Run **standalone** `mvnw clean install` in each changed module before PR (see root `AGENTS.md`).
