## Reporting a Vulnerability

The Percussion CMS team takes security bugs seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

To report a security issue, email security@percussion.com and include the word "SECURITY:" in the subject line.  

> NOTE: We will acknowledge you as the reporter by default unless you specify otherwise on your report. 

The Percussion team will send a response indicating the next steps in handling your report. After the initial reply to your report, the team will keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement, and may ask for additional information or guidance.

If you have discovered a vulnerability in a third party component or library, please report that vulnerability directly to that projects maintainer(s).
