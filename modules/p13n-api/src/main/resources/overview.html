<h1>Personalization API</h1>
Personalization (also known as P13N) is composed of three major Systems that follow a Service Oriented Architecture.
<table>
	<thead><tr><th>System</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead>
	<tr><td>Visitor Tracking</td><td>See {@link com.percussion.soln.p13n.tracking} </td></tr>
	<tr><td>Content Delivery</td><td>See {@link com.percussion.soln.p13n.delivery}</td></tr>
	<tr><td>Segmentation</td><td>See {@link com.percussion.soln.segment}</td></tr>
</table>
<h1>Very High Overview</h1>
Personalization works by associating segments or tags of a certain weight with visitors and then 
by selectively displaying content based on those weights.
<p>
This is done in two steps when a visitor visits a web page:
<ol>
<li>Track the visitor by setting segment weights associated with the page onto the visitor. ({@link com.percussion.soln.p13n.tracking Tracking})</li>
<li>Portions of the page are filled through dynamic list of HTML snippets whose contents 
get filtered based on the segment weights. ({@link com.percussion.soln.p13n.delivery Delivery})</li>
</ol>
<em><small>Some pages may only do one of those two steps.</small></em>
</p>
<h2>Example of personalization</h2>
Imagine a new visitor visiting page <em>A</em> that is tagged with segments <b>"US"</b> and <b>"Customer"</b>.
The visitor will have a profile like:
<table  border="1">
<tr><th>Segment Identifier</th><th>Weight</th></tr>
<tr><td>US</td><td>1</td></tr>
<tr><td>Customer</td><td>1</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
If page <em>A</em> has a dynamic list with three snippets:
<table border="1">
<tr><th>Snippet</th><th>Segments</th></tr>
<tr><td>I</td><td>International,Contractor</td></tr>
<tr><td>J</td><td>US,Contractor</td></tr>
<tr><td>K</td><td>US,Customer</td></tr>
</table>
and the list has a maximum size of 2 and minimum size of 1.
<p>
The list will be displayed for the visitor as:
<table border="1">
<tr><th>Snippet</th><th>Score</th><tr>
<tr><td>K</td><td>2</td></tr>
<tr><td>J</td><td>1</td></tr>
</table>
<h2>Content Contributors Control Personalization</h2>
Content contributors can actively control personalization of dynamic lists
by setting properties on the list 
and by associating segments with snippets in the list and by associating segments with landing pages.
<p>
Segmenting landing pages will cause visitors to have their profile updated to the matching segments
usually by increasing it by one. This update is known as the <em>"update"</em> tracking action.
