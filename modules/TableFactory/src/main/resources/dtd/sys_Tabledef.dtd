<!--
  This dtd specifies elements used to define the schema for a set of tables,
  along with instructions for creating or updating each table. This set
  is processed in the order in which it is specified.

  Since tables may be dropped and recreated during processing, there may be
  problems dropping tables that are referenced by foreign key constraints.
  The solution to this is to specify the table containing the foreign key
  constraint twice - once before the table(s) it references, excluding the
  foreign key constraint defintion, and then again after, specifying
  alter="y" and including just the foreign key constraint definition and
  columns defintions for the internal columns it references. This will
  allow both drops and creates to be processed without error. Any table
  data provided will only be processed with the first table definition.
-->
<!ELEMENT tabledefset (tabledef+)>

<!--
  Specifies a single table's schema, including column, primary key, and
  foreign keys.

  Attributes:
  name - The name of the table. This MUST be the simple table name, it will
      be fully qualified internally.

  create - Determines if the table is to be created if it does not already
      exist, or recreated if it does already exist.

      If "y", table is created if it does not aleady exist, and data is
      inserted if supplied. If it already exists and is empty, existing
      table is dropped and new table is created, and data is inserted if
      supplied. If table exists and contains data, then the action taken
      depends on the delolddata value. This is the default action if this
      attribute is not specified.

      If "n", table is only altered and/or data modified if it already exists.

  delolddata - If the table exists and create = "y", this value is used to
      determine the action taken. If the table does not exist, exists but
      is empty, or if create = "n", then this value is ignored. Otherwise:

      If "y", table is dropped, recreated, and data is inserted if
      supplied.

      If "n", and table has data, then backup of table is made, new table
      is created, and data from the backup is copied to the new table. If
      the creation of the new table fails, the backup is restored. Then any
      data modifications supplied are processed. This is the default action
      if this attribute is not specified.

  alter - Determines if the child elements of the table are to be treated as
      the complete schema definition, or only the changes to be made. This
      value is ignored if create = "y".

      If "y", then the elements supplied are treated as changes. Each
      element (column, primary key, foreign key) are handled based
      on their action attribute. Any data modifications specified will be
      ignored (a message will be logged that they are being skipped).

      If "n", then a the full table schema must be provided, and the action
      attribute of each element is ignored.

  allowSchemaChanges - Specifies whether or not table schema changes are
      allowed or not. Optional, defaults to "y".

      If "y" or not specified, schema changes are allowed and depend on the
      attribute settings of this element.

      If "n", schema changes are not allowed. This overwrites all attributes
      regarding schema changes in this element.

<!ATTLIST tabledef

<!--
  Container for each of the column definitions for this table.
-->
<!ELEMENT rowdef (columndef+)>

<!--
  Container for each column that is part of the primary key.

  Attributes:
  action - The action to take:
      c: create - primary key is created if it does not already exist
      r: replace - existing primary key is removed and then re-created.
      d: delete - existing primary key is removed.
      n: none - no action taken.

  name - The name of the constraint (optional). Should be provided if the
      table name is more than 15 characters, and should be no more than 18
      characters to ensure compatiblity with all databases.
-->
<!ELEMENT primarykey (name+)>
<!ATTLIST primarykey

<!--
  Container for each column that is part of the foreign key.

  Attributes:
  action - The action to take:
      c: create - foreign key is created if it does not already exist
      r: replace - existing foreign key is removed and then re-created.
      d: delete - existing foreign key is removed.
      n: none - no action taken.

<!--
  Container for a list of unique index or constraint defintions.
-->
<!ELEMENT indexdefinitions (index+)>

<!--
  Container for each column that is part of the update key, used instead
  of the primary key columns if defined.
-->
<!ELEMENT updatekey (name+)>

<!--
  Defines a column as part of a row.  Sub-elements are used
  only when creating the column as part of a row.

  Attributes:
  name - The name of the column. This MUST be the simple column name, it will
      be fully qualified internally.
  action - The action to take for this column:
      c: create - column is created if it does not already exist
      r: replace - existing column is removed and then re-created.
      d: delete - existing column is removed.
      n: none - no action taken.

  Sequence columns are used when adding key sequences to the target data.

<!ELEMENT columndef (jdbctype, size?, allowsnull, scale?, defaultvalue?, sequence?)>
<!ATTLIST columndef
	name CDATA #REQUIRED
	action (c | r | d | n) "c"
>

<!--
   The sequence element contains the name of the sequence used to generate
   this column. This element will normally be used with primary key columns.
   For databases such as Sybase that support IDENTITY columns, a non-null
   value for SEQUENCE indicates that this is an IDENTITY column.
-->
<!ELEMENT sequence (#PCDATA)>

<!--
  Container for each column that is part of a unique index or constraint.
  This is used to represent both a unique index and a unique constraint
  in a table schema, and the action to perform when that table schema is
  used to create or modify a table.  Unique indexes and unique constriants
  are considered to be interchangeable, and in most dbms systems, unique
  constraints are implemented using unique indexes.  When a table is
  cataloged, all unique index columns are queried to construct this
  object.  If this object is being created in the database as a result of
  processing a table schema,  it is created as a unique constraint.

  Attributes:
  action - The action to take:
      c: create - constraint is created if it does not already exist
      r: replace - existing constraint is removed and then re-created.
      d: delete - existing constraint is removed.
      n: none - no action taken.
-->

<!--
  The jdbctype of the column. Must be a valid string representation of a
  valid jdbctype.
-->
<!ELEMENT jdbctype (#PCDATA)>

<!--
  size = the length of the data type. This value will be interperated slightly
  differently for each data type: number of characters for a string value,
  number of bytes for a LOB value, or number of digits (precision) for a
  numeric value. If this value is not supplied for a data type that supports
  size, the data type map will provide a default value.
-->
<!ELEMENT size (#PCDATA)>

<!--
  scale = the number of digits to the right of the decimal point in numeric
  data types. If this value is not supplied for a data type that supports
  scale, the data type map will provide a default value.
-->
<!ELEMENT scale (#PCDATA)>

<!--
  If "yes" then field will be created to allow null values. If "no", it
  will be created to required non-null values.

<!--
  If adding a column to an existing table, this will be used as the value.
  This is not set as the default value in the columns definition in the
  database.
-->

<!--
  Defines a column that is part of a foreign key constraint. Defines
  the name of the column, the name of the external table, and the
  name of the column in the external table.
