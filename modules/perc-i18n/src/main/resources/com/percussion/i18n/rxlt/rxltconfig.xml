<!-- Configuration file for the Percussion Language Tool. Packaged as part of JAR file.
User should never need to edit this. The default settings are suitable for the
post installer to run the tool so that the language translation keys are generated
from the existing system and merged with the server resource bundle. Merging with
the server resource bundle is a kind of redundant since meging is done with
untranslated keywords. The real process will be complete only when the file
(tobetranslated.tmx) is given to translation service and merged after translation.
