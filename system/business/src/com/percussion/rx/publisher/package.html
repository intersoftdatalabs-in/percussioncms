<h1><font face="Arial">
	The Publishing System 
</font></h1>
<p><font face="Arial"> 
	The publishing system takes a unit of work to publish, called an 
	edition, and executes the edition. The edition consists of a series of 
	content lists, each of which identify zero or more content items to be 
	assembled using specified templates and places in calculated locations. 
	The edition also references a site, which defines where filesystem 
	content will be published, as well as identifying other per-site 
	information to be used in assembly and delivery. 
</font><h2><font face="Arial"> 
	The Publishing Job 
</font></h2>
<p><font face="Arial"> 
	The central concept in publishing is the job. The job can be thought of 
	as an instantiation of the edition. The job reads the site and edition 
	data, runs pre and post edition tasks, and manages the assembly and 
	delivery of the content. 
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"> 
	The job sends the content to be assembled to the publishing queue. A 
	configured set of processors take the assembly items and produce 
	delivery results. The delivery results are sent to the delivery 
	manager, which invokes the appropriate delivery handler. The handler 
	then either stores the result for later delivery when the job 
	&quot;commits&quot;, or delivers right away for old style 
	<em>IPSPublisher</em> handlers. 
</font></p><font face="Arial"> 
Each job is identified by a job id. The id is a 64 bit number. This 
number is incremented for each job run and will never, in a practical 
sense, repeat. If the customer were to somehow run 1000 jobs every 
second, it would still take almost 600 million years to repeat. I think 
we can safely assume that Rhythmyx will not exist in its current form at 
that time. At a more realistic rate of running jobs, billions of years 
would go by. 
<br></font>
<p><font face="Arial"> 
	Each item is identified by a reference id, which are also 64 bit 
	numbers. Since there are many items per job, this will repeat 
	substantially more quickly. Yet even a thousand years hence, one 
	suspect that clearing out the database would be the least worry. So the 
	reference id will not repeat in a period of time we're worried about. 
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"> 
	The job id is used for the status table and the reference id is used 
	for the items table. Both tables are periodically purged of old 
	content. Since this is the only storage of those ids, there will never 
	be more than a relatively small number of the ids in the database over 
	a period of time. 
</font></p>
<h2><font face="Arial"> 
	Publishing Handler 
</font></h2>
<p><font face="Arial">The publishing handler accepts work to be done from the publishing queue. 
The handler first uses the assembly service to create an assembly result and then 
calls the delivery manager to deliver the content. It sends status to the  
publishing results handler via the result queue. 
</font><h2><font face="Arial">Publishing Results Handler</font></h2>
<p><font face="Arial">The publishing results handler takes status updates and forwards them to the 
business publisher service, which maintains the job state and updates the database via
the publisher service.</font>
