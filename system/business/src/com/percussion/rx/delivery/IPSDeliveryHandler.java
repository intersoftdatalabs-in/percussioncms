/**
 * A delivery handler is responsible for delivering assembled content to a 
 * location determined by a location scheme or by the assembly process itself.
 * The delivery handler manages the delivery and may optionally perform the 
 * delivery in a transactional manner.
 * <p>
 * Delivery handlers are invoked in a multi-threaded environment and must be
 * coded accordingly, with global data properly protected from simultaneous
 * thread access.
 * <p>
 * The use of the word transactional in this context does not refer to the 
 * standard ACID criteria. Rather it really talks about the delivery handler
 * buffering the published changes to the end of the job, and applying those
 * as an all or nothing batch. This enables us to keep web sites more generally
 * consistent, longer than if we were outputting changes on a per delivery 
 * mechanism.
