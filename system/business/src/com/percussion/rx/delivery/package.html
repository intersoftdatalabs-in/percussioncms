<h1><font face="Arial">The Delivery System</font></h1>
<p><font face="Arial">The delivery system takes results from assembly, interprets the delivery type 
and eventually delivers them to the appropriate destination. The assembly results  
may be stored between the initial delivery and the eventual end of the publishing 
job. 
</font><p><font face="Arial">A delivered item may either add or remove an item from the destination. When
the job is committed, the items to be removed (unpublished) are handled first. Then
the items to be replaced or added are handled.
</font><h2><font face="Arial">Status</font></h2>
<p><font face="Arial">
As each item is delivered and when the items are committed, status is returned
from the handler. This status is passed along to the publishing results handler,
which uses it to signal the publishing system that the particular item has changed
state, and whether the delivery or committal is a success or failure. Failure messages
are accumulated for the given item in the item status table.
</font></p><h2><font face="Arial">Transational Behavior</font></h2><font face="Arial">The use of the word transactional in this context does not refer to the&nbsp; standard ACID criteria. Rather it really talks about the delivery handler buffering the published changes to the end of the job, and applying those as an all or nothing batch. This enables us to keep web sites more generally consistent, longer than if we were outputting changes on a per delivery&nbsp; mechanism.</font>
