Saving for College

It's amazng how fastyour children grow up.  One day they're starting kidnergarten, the next they're packing for college.  Even more incredible is how the cost of higher education seems to grow as fast as the children.  In the past twenty years, the cost of a higher education has more than tripled.

According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, between 1979 and 2001,, the tuition component of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) grew an average or 8% per year.  Assuming prices continue to grow at the same rate, a child born today faces college costs between three and four times the current cost by their freshman yar.

As a parent, you can expect to play between half and two-thirds of your child's college costs using a combination of sxavings, loans, and current income.  Grants and scholarships generally provide only a third of total college costs.

Given these realities, it is crticial to start saving for your child's education as early as possible, even as early and the day they are born.  The earlier you begin to save, the more time you money will have to grow.

Even a modest investment every week or every month, if started early enough, can grow into a significant college fund by the time you child starts college.  For example. Saving a mere $50 per month from the day your child is born would yield $20,000 by the time they turn 17.  Raising the amount to $200 per month would yeild nearly $80,000.
