Section 529 College Savings Plans

Looking for a way to save money for your child's higher education? Section 529 college savings plans offer tax advantages while helping you save.

Your tax advisor can help you determine the best way to take advantage of a 529 plan, but you should be familiar with their general characteristics:

Interest and dividends are tax deferred.  You pay no federal taxes on withdrawals used to pay for higher education.  Some states also offer tax credits on contributions.

Anyone can opent an account on behalf of a particular student, whether or not they are related.  If multiple friends or realtives individually want to contribute to a particular student, each sets up a savings account of their own, naming the student as the benficiary.  

Every state has one or more plans of its own (and the District of Columbia offers plans as well).  You can invest in any state's plan, regardless of whether you reside there.  Some states, however, offer special benefits to residents or students who choose to attend college in their state.

Funding a 529plan can reduce your taxable estate, but Federal gift tax rules still apply.  The annual limit on gifts from one person to another before incurring gift taxes is $11,000 ($22,000 for married couples).  Contributions to 529 plans, including contributions by parents, count against this limit.  

The federal tax code includes a special provision for larger gifts.  An individual can contribute $55,000 during one year and not pay the gift tax, provided they do not make any additional gifts to the same student over the next five years.

Some plans have a minimum active period before withdrawals can be made without incurring a penalty.

Some plans place a cap on the total contributions allowed for a particular student.

Be careful not to set aside too much beyond the amount the student would reasonably need to fund their higher education.  Excessive funds remaining may incur tax penalties.
