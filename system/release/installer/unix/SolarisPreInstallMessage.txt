If you are performing a new installation of Rhythmyx, 
then you must create a system account for Rhythmyx, 
login into the system with that account and then 
run the installation. You must then use the new 
account for running Rhythmyx and performing updates 
to the Rhythmyx installation.


If you are performing an update to an existing Rhythmyx 
installation, then you must login into the system 
with the same account under which you installed 
and run Rhythmyx. Also make sure that this account 
has read and write permissions on all the files 
under the Rhythmyx root directory.
