# workers.properties -
#
# This file provides jk derived plugins with the needed information to
# connect to the different tomcat workers.  Note that the distributed
# version of this file requires modification before it is usable by a
# plugin.
#
# As a general note, the characters $( and ) are used internally to define
# macros. Do not use them in your own configuration!!!
#
# Whenever you see a set of lines such as:
# x=value
# y=$(x)\something
#
# the final value for y will be value\something
#
# Normaly all you will need to do is un-comment and modify the first three
# properties, i.e. workers.tomcat_home, workers.java_home and ps.
# Most of the configuration is derived from these.
#
# When you are done updating workers.tomcat_home, workers.java_home and ps
# you should have 3 workers configured:
#
# - An ajp12 worker that connects to localhost:8007
# - An ajp13 worker that connects to localhost:8009
# - A jni inprocess worker.
# - A load balancer worker
#
# However by default the plugins will only use the ajp12 worker. To have
# the plugins use other workers you should modify the worker.list property.
#
#

# OPTIONS ( very important for jni mode ) 

#
# workers.tomcat_home should point to the location where you
# installed tomcat. This is where you have your conf, webapps and lib
# directories.
#
workers.tomcat_home=/var/tomcat3

#
# workers.java_home should point to your Java installation. Normally
# you should have a bin and lib directories beneath it.
#
workers.java_home=/opt/IBMJava2-13

#
# You should configure your environment slash... ps=\ on NT and / on UNIX
# and maybe something different elsewhere.
#
ps=/
