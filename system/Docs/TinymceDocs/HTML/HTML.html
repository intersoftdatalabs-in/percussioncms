The rich text editor is a WYSIWIG editor that  formats HTML code. Use the <img src="cuihtml.gif" /> button to toggle between rich rext mode and HTML mode, which enables you to correct your HTML markup or to work in HTML.<br /><br /></p>
<h3 id="To_use_the_HTML_editor:" class="showhide_heading">To use HTML mode:</h3>
<ol>
<li>Click <img src="cuihtml.gif" /> to switch to HTML mode. <br />The editor looks the same, but many of the buttons are disabled. Any content that you have entered as rich text now appears as HTML markup. </li>
<li>Modify or view the HTML text, or proceed to work in HTML. </li>
<li>When you are done, either click [<strong>SAVE</strong>] to save your changes and return to the page in the Content tab (the rich text editor closes in both rich text mode and HTML mode),  or click  <img src="cuihtml.gif" /> to return to rich text mode. <br />Note that when you when you click [<strong>SAVE</strong>] or  <img src="cuihtml.gif" />, the HTML editor may reformat markup into notations that it prefers and attempts to remove invalid markup. After you save your content in either mode, the editor inserts &lt;div&gt; tags around your HTML markup unless they are already present. <br/> </li>
