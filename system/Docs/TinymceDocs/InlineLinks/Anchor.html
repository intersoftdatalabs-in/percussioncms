<h2 id="Insert_Edit_Anchor_Dialog_and_Field_Definitions" class="showhide_heading">Insert/Edit Anchor Dialog and  Field Definitions</h2>
<p>This dialog is accessed from the rich text editor when you  place your cursor at a specific point in the text to insert an anchor or when  you select an existing anchor and click <img src="cuiaddanchorbutton.gif" /> in the rich text editor toolbar. An anchor inserted in the  text enables a link in this page or another page to jump to the anchor's  location (so the web visitor is taken to a specific topic or definition  mentioned in the text).<br /><img src="cuiinsertanchordialog.gif" /></p>

<h3 id="Fields" class="showhide_heading">Fields</h3>
<p><strong>Anchor name</strong> - A value for  a name attribute for the anchor tag in the HTML source code for the rich text  content. The dialog does not require you to enter this field, but if you do not  enter an <strong>Anchor name</strong>, it is not possible for a link to access this  anchor.</p>
