		<H2> Insert Existing Image </H2>
<p>You insert an existing image into a rich text editor by selecting an image that  is already stored in CMS as an asset. <em>Currently, you can only insert existing images stored as assets in CM1 into the rich text editor.</em><br /><br />To insert an existing image into a  rich text editor:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open a rich  text editor widget for edit.</li>
<li>Click in the location in the text where you want to insert the image.
<li>Click <img src="cuiimagebutton.gif" />. <br />The <a href="InsertImageDialog.html">Insert/Edit Image dialog</a> opens. </li>
<li>In the General tab, click [<strong>Use Existing Image</strong>]. <br />The Select Image  dialog opens. <br /><img src="cuiselectimagedialog.gif" /><br />The box at the  bottom of the dialog lists the <em>Assets</em> root node that  appears in the Finder. </li>
<li>Double-click <em>Assets</em> and navigate through the folder structure until  you find an image asset that you want to select. <br />If you want to move back up  the folder structure, select a folder in the <strong>Location</strong> drop list. </li> Images are stored either in the default Assets/uploads/images folder or in user-created folders. 
<li>Click the image name that you want to insert into the rich text. <br />The name appears in the <strong>Image Name</strong> field. </li>
<br /><img src="cuiimagenameselected.gif" />
<li>Click [<strong>Save</strong>] to return to the <a href="InsertImageDialog.html">Insert/Edit Image dialog</a>. The fields are now filled with information from the selected image,  and the <strong>Preview</strong> box displays the image. <br /><img src="cuiimageselected1.gif" /><br />(If you  do not want to insert an image, click [<strong>Cancel</strong>] in the Select Image dialog  to return to the <a href="InsertImageDialog.html">Insert/Edit Image dialog</a>. The fields in the Insert/Edit Image dialog remain unfilled.) </li>
<li>Once the Insert/Edit Image dialog displays the image and its properties, you  can change the <strong>Image description</strong> and the <strong>Title fields</strong>. To create a  thumbnail image in <strong>Image size</strong>, click the <em>Thumbnail Image</em> radio  button. The <strong>Preview</strong> box now displays the thumbnail image. <br />If you want  to change the default appearance of the image, go to the <a href="InsertImageDialog.html">Insert/Edit Image dialog</a>. </li>
<li>After you have completed your customization of the image, click  [<strong>Insert</strong>] on either the General tab or the Appearance tab to insert the image into the rich text editor. </li>
