<h6 class="heading6">Expand Query with Synonyms</h6>
<p class="bodytext">When <strong class="specialbold">Expand Query with Synonyms</strong> is checked, the search engine searches on words with similar meanings to the words you enter as well as matching the characters entered. For example, suppose you entered the phrase &quot;job seeker&quot; as a query.  The search engine might return content items that include the words &quot;applicant&quot;, &quot;candidate&quot;, &quot;hired&quot;, and &quot;opening&quot; as well as content items that include the phrase &quot;job seeker&quot;.  </p>
<p class="bodytext"><strong class="specialbold">Expand Query with Synonyms </strong>does not work properly if you enter special characters or wild cards.  In a simple search, if you enter special characters or wild cards and check <strong class="specialbold">Expand Query with Synonyms</strong>, the search is not expanded to query with synonyms. In an advanced search, if you enter special characters or wild cards and check <strong class="specialbold">Expand Query with Synonyms</strong>, a warning indicates that the special characters are treated as word breaks.</p>
<p class="bodytext">By default, <strong class="specialbold">Expand Query with Synonyms </strong>is not checked.</p>
