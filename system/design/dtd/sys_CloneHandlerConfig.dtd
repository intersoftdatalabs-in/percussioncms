<!--
   Conditional clone handlers use process checks to decide things like
   clone at all, should a deep or shallow clone be made, etc. The
   clone handler needs to know all checks it uses upfront. The checks are
   addressed through the name attribute.
   
   name - a configuration wide unique name for the process check. This
      name is used by conditional clone handlers to decide what 
      processing steps to take.
   
   context - specifies the context in which the specified checks are
      processed. For we have 2 contexts, object and relationship.
      
   sequence - defines the order in which the process checks are 
      executed. If 2 checks have the same sequence number, they
      will be processed in the order they are specified.
