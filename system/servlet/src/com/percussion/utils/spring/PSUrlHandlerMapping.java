/**
 * Provides access to the matching path pattern used by the
 * {@link PSWebDavServletController} to delegate to the
 * {@link PSPassThruDispatcherServlet}. Capture the mapping of the path pattern
 * to a dispatch handler during initialization and stores it in a static member.
 * At runtime, when the Spring framework uses the mapping to lookup the request
 * dispatcher, the path that was matched on is stored in thread local storage,
 * and the {@link #getUrlPath()} method then provides access to that path. This
 * way the <code>PSWebdavServlet</code> can call this method to determine the
 * base path to which the request was matched, and that can be compared to the
 * request URL from the servlet request to determine the non-base portion of
 * that path.
 * <p>
 * The special handler <q>[default]</q> is used for non-matching paths when
 * matching in {@link #lookupHandler(String, HttpServletRequest)}.
