Introduction
------------

RxVerifyTable provides an installation check module to verify your 
Rhythmyx installation database. 

Running
-------

To run RxVerifyTable, you must either have a java executable on your path, or
use a full pathname to access the java executable in your Rhythmyx
directory. To run the utility in the same directory you've unzipped the
tool into:

1) Run verification checks
java -jar rxverifytable.jar rhythmyxdir [-help] [-debug]

This will check the database for table existence, primary key, index, and foreign key

use -help to display detailed help information
use -debug to turn debugging on

The tool will output its actions to the console, and will also record 
them in a file in the current directory, rxverify.log. This file will not
be overwritten on each run; instead it will be appended to. The log 
entries include the date to allow you to see what was run when.
