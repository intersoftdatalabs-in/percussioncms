Introduction
------------

RxVerify provides a set of installation check modules to verify your 
Rhythmyx installation. At this time the following modules are implemented:

1) Installed Logs verification
2) Database Tables verification
3) Extensions verification
4) XSL Version verification
5) Installed Files verification

Running
-------

To run RxVerify, you must either have a java executable on your path, or
use a full pathname to access the java executable in your Rhythmyx
directory. To run the utility in the same directory you've unziped the
tool into:

1) Run verification checks
java -jar rxverifyqa.jar rhythmyxdir -tableindexes

This will check the database for table existence, primary key, index, and foreign key

2) For more thorough checks, QA use, generate .bom file
java -jar rxverifyqa.jar rhythmyxdir -generate billofmaterials.bom [-force]

-force will overwrite the current .bom file

**Note: It is only necessary to generate once

Run verification checks
java -jar rxverifyqa.jar rhythmyxdir -verify billofmaterials.bom -options 

-options must be one of the following:
-all verifies entire installation
-logs verifies installation logfiles
-files verifies installation files
-tables verifies database tables for column
-xslversion verifies xsl version
-extensions verifies extensions
-help displays help

You can also list the contents of the .bom file with the following command:
java -jar rxverifyqa.jar -list billofmaterials.bom

The tool will output its actions to the console, and will also record 
them in a file in the current directory, rxverify.log. This file will not
be overwritten on each run; instead it will be appended to. The log 
entries include the date to allow you to see what was run when.

Understanding the Output
------------------------

The output from the tool is logged in sections. Each fix module is run,
and each attempts to summarize what it has done.
