<!--
  This dtd specifies a set of mappings used to convert JDBC data types to
  the corresponding native data type.
-->

<!--
  A list of maps, each corresponding to a particular back-end database type. 
  Each map may be JDBC driver and operating system specific if necessary.
-->
<!ELEMENT DataTypeMaps (DataTypeMap+)>

<!--
  A set of datatype mappings for a particular backend driver.
  
  Attributes:
  for - The name of the backend alias.  Currently supported values are:
      MSSQL, ORACLE, MSACCESS, DB2.  At a minimum this or "driver" 
      must be specified.  
  driver - specifies the jdbc driver name(s).  The driver name being used
      will be matched on this value.  At a minimum this or "for" must 
      be specified.  
  os - Optionally specifies the operating system(s).  This is used to handle
      an rdbms that has different native types on different operating 
      systems.  If a list, must be delimited with semi_colons.
  maxIndexColSize - The maximum size for any column that may be included in an
  	  index definition.  Defaults to -1 (unlimited) if not specified.   Used to
  	  avoid creating indexes that exceed the backend's maximum allowable 
  	  size of combined index column values.  Applies only to columns that 
  	  contain character data (CHAR, VARCHAR), and specifies the number of 
  	  characters.

<!--
  The mapping from JDBC type to native type.

  Attributes:
  jdbc - the string representation of the JDBC data type.
  native - the string representation of the native data type.  Must not include
           any size/precision parameter.
  defaultSize - provides a default size/precision to be used when the table
                definition does not provide one.  This attribute must be
                defined if the data type supports size/precision.
  defaultScale - provides a default scale to be used when the table defintion
                 does not provide one.  This attribute must be defined if the
                 data type supports scale.
  suffix - an optional clause to be appended after the native string and
           precision and scale parameters.  Some databases have data types that
           require this addition text; for example, DB2's VARBINARY data type
           is specifed as "VARCHAR () FOR BIT DATA".  "FOR BIT DATA" is the
           suffix.
           
  isNative2Jdbc -  optional attribute. Indicates if this mapping should be used 
	to provide the JDBC data type corresponding to the native data type. If two 
	or more JDBC data types map to the same native data type (for example, 
	both java.sql.Types#CLOB and java.sql.Types#LONGVARCHAR 
	map to native type "NTEXT" on  SQL Server) then this attribute can be 
	specified on one of the mappings. The JDBC data type of the mapping 
	with this attribute specified will be used if the native type of the column 
	matches the native type of this mapping. If two or more mappings have
	this attribute specified then an attempt will be made to make an exact match 
	on the precision and scale attributes if defined.  If no match is made, the
	first mapping will be used and others will be ignored.
