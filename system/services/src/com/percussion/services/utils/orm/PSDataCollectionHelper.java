/**
 * This class manages id sets in a temporary table in the database. It is
 * initialized by the spring bean configuration.
 * <H2>Description</h2>
 * Hibernate has an important limitation that an <em>in</em> clause is
 * implemented as a series of comparisons. For example:
 * <pre>
 *     x in (1, 2, 3)
 * </pre>
 * becomes
 * <pre>
 *     (x = 1) or (x = 2) or (x = 3)
 * </pre>
 * further, hibernate passes the values 1, 2 and 3 as parameters, so the
 * expression is really:
 * <pre>
 *     (x = ?) or (x = ?) or (x = ?)
 * </pre>
 * with 1, 2, and 3 passed as parameters. This proves to be a problem for JDBC
 * drivers as the total number of passed parameters is limited. For jTDS this is
 * around 1000, and Oracle has a similar limitation. This then requires that we
 * avoid the problem.
 * <p>
 * This class implements a temporary storage pool that allows a collection of
 * numeric ids to be stored away. The user of this can take one of a couple of
 * approaches: either do this all the time, or only do this when the collection
 * is large.
 * {@link IPSCmsObjectMgr#filterItemsByPublishableFlag(java.util.List, List)}
 * does this in a conditional fashion, as does the query engine.
 * <h2>Example usage:</h2>
 * <pre>
 * idset = PSDataCollectionHelper.createIdSet(s, cids);
 * q = s.createQuery(&quot;SELECT c.m_contentId &quot;
 *       + &quot;FROM PSComponentSummary c, PSState s, PSTempId t &quot;
 *       + &quot;WHERE c.m_contentId = t.pk.itemId AND &quot; 
 *       + &quot;t.pk.id = :idset AND &quot;
 *       + &quot;c.m_workflowAppId = s.workflowId AND &quot;
 *       + &quot;c.m_contentStateId = s.stateId AND &quot;
 *       + &quot;s.contentValidValue in (:flags)&quot;);
 * q.setParameter(&quot;idset&quot;, idset);
 * q.setParameterList(&quot;flags&quot;, flags);
 * </pre>
 * This sets up the collection, which is then passed as just an id to the join
 * in the query. Note the use of <em>t.pk</em> to find the data. Later the
 * collection is removed:
 * <pre>
 * if (idset != 0)
 * {
 *    PSDataCollectionHelper.clearIdSet(s, idset);
 * }
 * </pre> 
 * IDs are allocated using the GUID manager, which ensures that multiple running
 * implementations will not collide in the table.
 * <p>
 * Note, due to a potential database deadlock (which we had experienced from
 * a SQL server, where sub-query select and delete IDs from the PSX_TEMPID table 
 * at the same time caused deadlock in SQL Server), {@link #executeQuery(Query)
 * and {@link #createIdSet(Session, Collection)} can be processed from more than one 
 * thread at the same time, but {@link #clearIdSet(Session, long)} can only be 
 * processed from one thread at a time.
