/**
 * The content manager allows the loading of content items by either GUID or
 * path. Guids and paths can reference either content items or children. You
 * will need to construct special GUIDs to reference either. See
 * {@link com.percussion.services.guidmgr.data.PSLegacyGuid} for more details.
 * <p>
 * Path syntax uses the title fields from folders and items. The path starts
 * with a
 * <q>//</q>
 * for absolute paths. Relative paths start with no slash character. Paths
 * ending in #<em>nnn</em> indicate a specific revision of a content item.
 * <p>
 * Examples:<br/> <em>//Sites/EnterpriseInvestments/Funds/Morningfund</em>
 * references the
 * <q>Morningfund</q>
 * document in the
 * <q>Funds</q>
 * directory.<br/> <em>//Sites/CorporateInvestments/Company/R-and-B#2</em>
 * references revision 2 of the document
 * <q>R-and-B</q>
 * <br/> <em>//Sites/CorporateInvestments/Regions/NorthEast#3/Category#1</em>
 * references the first Category child of revision 3 of the
 * <q>NorthEast</q>
 * document
