<title>Query subsystem</title>

<body>
<h1>Organization</h1>
<p>The query engine is built in several pieces. The front-end parsers
for SQL and XPath produce a PSQuery object. That object contains the
following pieces of information:
<ul>
	<li>The projection, which is a list of fields or the value <q>*</q> to
	indicate that nodes should be returned
	<li>The list of zero or more content types. Zero indicates that all
	content types should be searched
	<li>The sort specification, which is zero or more fields, each
	specified to sort in ascending or descending order
	<li>A query node tree
</ul>
The query node tree is passed through a transformer, which replaces the
properties jcr:path, jcr:primaryType and jcr:mixinType with an
equivalent check that can be evaluated. The initial transformer also
does a small measure of checking to see that no functions are used -
functions are not implemented at this time.
<p>
Note that the nodes are intentionally immutable. The transformers replace nodes
as required. 
<h2>Building HQL</h2>
<p>Once the query node tree has been transformed, it is changed into an
HQL query. This is done in pieces. The hql transformer creates an HQL
where clause. Each use of the HQL carefully maps each implementation
class (that maps the legacy content type into content items) to the same
alias. With the addition to the legacy content type of a reference to
the content summary object, this is sufficient to do all queries that
are needed.
<h2>Performing a Query</h2>
<p>When the query is actually performed, the HQL is assembled for each
content type being searched. The results are aggregated and then sorted
according to the sort definition given. The results are then packaged
into a query results object.
<h2>Efficiencies</h2>
<p>There are really two kinds of searches: property projection searches
and node searches. They differ in the projection portion of the HQL
created.
<h2>Ordering</h2>
<p>The transformers are called in a specific order. The following table
discusses which need to be called and omissions for testing.
<table>
	<tr>
		<th>Transformer</th>
		<th>Notes</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>PSQueryTransformer</td>
		<td>This transformer replaces jcr: properties</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>PSQueryInternalizeProperties</td>
		<td>This transformer substitutes real object properties for the field
		names. These are the same for the legacy class, but different for 
		properties on the component summary (this is due to the object structure, 
		with the component summary being a separate object)</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>PSQueryWhereBuilder</td>
		<td>This takes the where clause and creates an appropriate HQL where
		clause.</td>
	</tr>
</table>
<h2>Sorting</h2>
<p>
The results are sorted according to the spec. This consists of either 
ordering the projection (which will have the sort properties included), or
ordering the result nodes.
