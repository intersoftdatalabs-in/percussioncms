		<title>Legacy Content Repository</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<h2>Basic Design</h2>
		<p>Each content type or content type child is represented by a
		combination of a
		<code>IPSTypeKey</code> and a <code>PSTypeConfiguration</code>.
		The key has two implementations, one for content types and one
		for content type children. The configuration contains two things:
		the list of bean classes that represent the type or child, and the 
		XML descriptor for Hibernate.
		</p>
		<p>All content types also get information from 
		<code>PSComponentSummary</code>, which is loaded as an annotated 
		class into the spring configuration for the session factory. </p>
		<h2>Session Factory Management</h2>
		<p>Each time the item def manager notes a change or set of
		changes to one or more content types, the content repository is 
		notified. If the item def manager is in a batch update mode then
		more than one update may be gathered together.</p>
		<p>When the configuration is updated, the internal configuration
		that is held in the repository is modified to correspond to the new
		global configuration. Then a new Hibernate session factory is created
		which can be used by the content repository.</p>
		<h2>Loading Content Items</h2>
		<p>The loading process is nearly the same for content items or item 
		children. The only difference is the primary keys and whether the 
		configuration includes <code>PSComponentSummary</code>. For each 
		table involved, a Java class is constructed using runtime information.
		Each field in the content type or child corresponds to a property
		in the constructed bean class.</p>
		<p>To load an item, an instance of each component class is loaded
		into memory using the calculated hibernate configuration. These
		are then proxied using a property wrapper and a property concrete
		class to form the properties for a content node. Body fields are
		proxied specially to ensure that the body contents are assembled
		during content assembly.</p>
