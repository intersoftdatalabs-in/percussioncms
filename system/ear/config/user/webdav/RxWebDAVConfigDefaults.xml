<!-- The WebDAV configuration information

     "root" - the virtual root path of the Rhythmyx for all resource 
              specified in the request. It must start from "Site" or "Folder"
              For example, root="//Site/mysite", root="//Folder/myfolder".
              It must be an existing folder. 

     "communityid" - the name of the community, which is used to communicate
                     with Rhythmyx Server.
              
     "communityname" - the name of the community, this is only a reference
                       to the communityid, but is not used by the WebDAV.

     "locale" - the locale that is used for the created items

     "deleteas" - an optional attribute, indicating the behavior of the 
                  DELETE operation (in DELETE, COPY and MOVE method). 
                  The possible values are:
                  
                  "purge":   indicate the DELETE operation will purge the
                             target items and/or folders. The purged items
                             will not be able to recovered afterwards.
                  "remove":  indicate the DELETE operation will remove the
                             folder relationships with the target items. The
                             removed items can be recovered afterwards. This
                             is the default behavior if this attribute is not
                             specified.
                             
      "publicValidTokens"  - comma separated list of chars for public state
                             default "y"
 
      "QEValidTokens"  - comma separated list of chars for quick-edit state
                         default "i"
