 * An extension handler is directly responsible for loading,

 * <p>
 * The implementation of an extension handler may actually be
 * responsible for executing the extensions, or it may instead
 * create IPSExtension objects which can execute on their own.
 * <p>
 * Implementations are not required to be thread-safe with respect
 * to installing, cataloging, removing, or otherwise managing
 * individual extensions. However, implementations must be aware
 * that multiple IPSExtension objects returned from prepare()
 * may be executed in different threads. That is, although multiple
 * threads will not call prepare() simultaneously, prepare() may
 * be called several times for a single extension, and the returned
 * IPSExtension object(s) may be used simultaneously from multiple
 * threads.
