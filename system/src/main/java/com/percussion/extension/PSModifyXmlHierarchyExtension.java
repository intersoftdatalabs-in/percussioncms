/**
 * This sample extension is used to modify an XML documents hierarchy.
 * <P>
 * The concept of XML hierarchy modification is based on the need for setting up
 * a discussion thread system. Each discussion topic submission can be
 * considered separately, thus having no relationship with other submissions.
 * However, most of the time, a submission may be a "response" to a previously
 * submitted topic. This creates a new discussion "thread" with response
 * submissions becoming children to a parent submission topic. A relationship
 * between the submissions is required to make this work.
 * <P>
 * To give a
 * relationship to different submission topics, a node-key pair comparison is
 * used in this exit extension to provide a hierarchical relationship between
 * submission topics. The 4 parameters are:
 * <UL>
 * <LI>response node: (required) This is the name of the XML node that contains
 * the attribute, or "response key", for looking up
 * parent node of this submission topic.
 * <LI>response key: (required) This is the attribute owned by the "response
 * node". This key defines which node is this response node's parent by looking
 * at the "parent key" defined in the "parent node".
 * <LI>parent node: (required) This is the name of the XML node that contains
 * the attribute, or "parent key", for holding the key where response
 * nodes would look up to find the parent.
 * <LI>parent key: (required) This is the attribute owned by the "parent node".
 * This key defines the value for the "response node" to try and match its
 * "response key" value for the determination if this "parent node" is the
 * parent. The value of the response key MUST BE UNIQUE amongst all the response
 * nodes!
 * </UL>
 * <P>
 * <BIG>Example:</BIG> Pay special attention to the relationship between
 * parentid and id attributes
 * <UL>
 * <LI>response node = Discussion/Topic
 * <LI>response key = Discussion/Topic/@parentid
 * <LI>parent node = Discussion/Topic
 * <LI>parent key = Discussion/Topic/@id
 * </UL>
 * <P>
 * Original XML Document:
 * <BR>
 * <PRE>
 * &lt;Discussion&gt;
 *   &lt;Topic id="1" parentid="0"&gt;
 *     &lt;body&gt;This is the first thread in the discussion&lt;/body&gt;
 *   &lt;/Topic&gt;
 *   &lt;Topic id="2" parentid="0"&gt;
 *     &lt;body&gt;This is the second thread in the discussion&lt;/body&gt;
 *   &lt;/Topic&gt;
 *   &lt;Topic id="3" parentid="1"&gt;
 *     &lt;body&gt;This is the first response to the first thread&lt;/body&gt;
 *   &lt;/Topic&gt;
 * &lt;/Discussion&gt;
 * </PRE>
 * <P>
 * After ModifyXmlHierarchyExtension exit:
 * <BR>
 * <PRE>
 * &lt;Discussion&gt;
 *   &lt;Topic id="1" parentid="0"&gt;
 *     &lt;body&gt;This is the first thread in the discussion&lt;/body&gt;
 *     &lt;Topic id="3" parentid="1"&gt;
 *       &lt;body&gt;This is the first response to the first thread&lt;/body&gt;
 *     &lt;/Topic&gt;
 *   &lt;/Topic&gt;
 *   &lt;Topic id="2" parentid="0"&gt;
 *     &lt;body&gt;This is the second thread in the discussion&lt;/body&gt;
 *   &lt;/Topic&gt;
 * &lt;/Discussion&gt;
