/**
 * This interface is used by Object store components whose state is saved in
 * a database rather than an XML file. The objects are still XML based. The
 * object uses the {@link PSDatabaseComponentLoader} class to perform the much
 * of the work of loading state. The conversion between the database state 
 * format and the object's XML format is done using an Rx application.
 * The database component loader will be used to generate xml elements that
 * conform to the model used in {@link IPSComponent#fromXml} for each 
 * component type. Saving will be done via generation of database modification
 * directives in XML format which can be sent to another Rx application for 
 * batch update processing.  This xml format will be accomplished by calling 
 * {@link #toDatabaseXml} in each component, which will decide what (if any) 
 * modifications to submit to the back end based on that component's state.
