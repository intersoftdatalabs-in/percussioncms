/**
 * Abstract base class for all jobs, implementing most methods for convenience
 * and providing a constructor for specifying the job id and descriptor.
 * Executes a job on a separate thread and allows it's status to be polled and
 * allows the job to be cancelled as well.
 * <p>
 * Classes implementing this interface must provide an implementation of
 * the {@link java.lang.Thread#run() run()} method, which is where the
 * work of the job is executed.  If any exceptions are encountered in the run
 * method, they should be logged if possible, the status should
 * be set to <code>-1</code> (see {@link #ABORT_STATUS}), and the status message 
 * updated with the error before the thread terminates.  All exceptions
 * should be handled in the run method.  Whenever run() terminates, 
 * {@link #setCompleted()} should be called, even if the job was cancelled or
 * aborted due to an error, so that the job handler can remove itself as a
 * listener and be unlocked.
