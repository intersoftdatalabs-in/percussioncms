 * This class extends {@link com.percussion.data.PSExecutionData

 * be instantiated with {@link  com.percussion.server.IPSRequestContext}. 
 * This is light in the sense that it is not a full fledged execution data and
 * does not have anything outside of {@link com.percussion.server.PSRequest}. 
 * Note that the ctor calls the super ctor with <code>null</code> for both 
 * application handler and request handler (the first and second parameters).
 * This class be used with care and intended (based on the current 
 * requirements) to execute conditionals that do not depend any data outside
 * of the {@link com.percussion.server.PSRequest} object.
