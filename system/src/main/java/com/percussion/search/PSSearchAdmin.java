/**
 * This class is part of the pluggable, full text search engine architecture.
 * <p>
 * Instances of this class must be obtained from the search engine interface.
 * <p>
 * This class provides access to the configuration information of the search
 * engine for modification and methods to manage the indexes.
 * <p>
 * The typical usage of this class is as follows (when starting up):
 * <ol>
 * <li>Call {@link #verify(Set)}to confirm with the external search engine
 * that the given set of content type ids are known to the system.
 * <li>Call {@link #update(PSItemDefinition, PSFieldRetriever, boolean) update}
 * for each content type.</li>
 * <li>Call {@link #save()}</li>
 * <li>Start the search engine (through the {@link PSSearchEngine}interface)
 * </li>
 * <ol>
 * <p>
 * While running, call <code>update</code> followed by <code>save</code> and
 * an engine restart each time a content editor is modified. Follow a similar
 * procedure each time a content editor is removed, except rather than calling
 * <code>update</code>, call <code>delete</code>.
 * <p>
 * Depending on the configuration changes required by the update, a re-index for
 * that content type may be required.
 * <p>
 * If the derived class does not override non-abstract methods, this class
 * manages the binary locator and item defition tracking.
 * <p>
 * This class may have {@link java.util.Observer Observers}registered that are
 * notified when an admin method is called. This is an implementation decision.

   /**
    * This method is used to modify the configuration of the search engine. The
    * configuration is driven by the content type definitions.
    * <p>
    * This method must be called for all running content types before the
    * indexer or query objects are used. This method may cause the server to
    * shut down and restart.
    * <p>
    * This method can be called in two different contexts. In one context, a
    * single content type has been added or updated. In that context, this
    * method will cause the information about the item definition to be updated
    * and the search server will restart immediately.
    * <p>
    * In the other context, a series of type modifications or registrations are
    * happening in a batch, e.g. MSM is installing a number of content types as
    * part of an archive. In this case, this method will be called with the
    * <code>notify</code> parameter set to <code>false</code> for all but
    * the final definition.
    * <p>
    * This first call will cause observers to know that a pending change has
    * started. Indexing will cease until they've been notified with the value
    * true. Note that the engine's update must be called first to avoid deadlock
    * issues.
    * 
    * @param def The content editor that is being added or modified. Never
    *           <code>null</code>.
    * 
    * @param retriever May be used by the indexer to obtain the content of
    *           unchanged binary fields. May be <code>null</code> if the
    *           supplied item has no binary fields in the parent or any complex
    *           child. A binary field is a field whose backend datatype is
    *           binary, or whose content editor definition has the 'treat as
    *           binary' flag set. May be <code>null</code> if the content type
    *           and all complex children don't contain binary fields.
    * 
    * @param notify This method is called in more than one context. When the
    *           server is initializing, this code is called for each content
    *           type. Later it is called when content type defintions change.
    *           This flag should be set to <code>false</code> to avoid having
    *           the underlying engine perform extra steps
    * 
    * @return <code>true</code> if the changes indicated by the newly supplied
    *         def require all content for this type to be re-indexed,
    *         <code>false</code> otherwise.
    * 
    * @throws PSSearchException If any problems occur.
