   /**
    * This method executes a basic search against the current indexes. The 
    * <code>globalQuery</code> is a search string that is generally concept 
    * based and is applied to all fields in an indexed unit. The <code>
    * fieldQueries</code> are a set of query strings that are generally 
    * 'boolean' based and are applied only to specific fields. The <code>
    * globalQuery</code> and all field specific search strings are effectively 
    * AND'd together to determine the final results.
    * <p>The syntax for all query strings is dependent on the implementation.
    * <p>A concept based search is one that performs various expansions of the
    * supplied words (such as finding items w/ 'eye' when the search word was
    * 'vision') and performs various statistics such as how many of the 
    * search words were in the item, how close (physically or logically)
    * they were to each other to determine a relevancy ranking.
    * <p>A boolean search is one that looks for exact matches, no expansion
    * of the supplied words is done except for wildcard expansion.
    * 
    * @param ctypeIds One of the search query filters. Each entry is a 
    * PSKey. May be <code>null</code> or empty. The search is 
    * limited to item fragments whose type matches one of those supplied. If 
    * none are supplied, all content types are allowed.
    *  
    * @param globalQuery This search parameter is applied to all fields 
    * that have been indexed. May be empty or <code>null</code>. 
    * 
    * @param fieldQueries 0 or more field specific query strings. Each entry
    * has a <code>String</code> as the key, which is the field name, and a 
    * <code>String</code> as value, which is the query string. Only item 
    * fragments whose specific field match the query will be considered. May 
    * be <code>null</code>.
    * 
    * @param controlProps A set of name-value pairs that control how the 
    * search is executed and how big the result set is. See the QUERYPROP_xxx
    * properties for descriptions of general properties. May be <code>null
    * </code> or empty to use default values as indicated for each 
    * property. Other allowed properties are determined by the implementation.
    * Property names are case-insensitive. If invalid values are supplied, the
    * default will be used. Keys and values are all <code>String</code> objects.
    * 
    * @return A list w/ 0 or more entries, up to a maximum of maxResults
    * entries, never <code>null</code>. Each entry is a PSSearchResult. The
    * locator in the result has the revision set to -1.
    * 
    * @throws PSSearchException If the query cannot be successfully completed
    * for any reason.
