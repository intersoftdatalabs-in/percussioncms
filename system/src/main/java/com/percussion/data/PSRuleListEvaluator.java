/**
 * A new concept known as a PSRule was added when the Content Editors were
 * first created. A rule is either a collection of conditionals or an
 * extension. Rules can be combined with boolean 'and' and 'or' operators
 * to create complex expressions. For the given list of rules, 'and' operations
 * will be considered to have higher precedence, which means that rules 
 * seperated by 'and' operators will be grouped and evaluated prior to 
 * applying 'or' operations.
 *
 * This class constructs an appropriate representation of the definitions
 * that can be executed repeatedly at run time using the {@link
 * #isMatch(PSExecutionData) isMatch} method.
