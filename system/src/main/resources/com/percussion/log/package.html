<BODY>

This specification defines the log handling model used by E2. The logging
mechanism is used internally by the E2 server to record various pieces of
information during execution which may be useful for debugging problems.
It can also be used as an audit trail.

<H2>Implementation Phases</H2>

Logging will be fully implemented in phase I due to its value in assisting
us to debug the product.


<H2>Writing to the Log</H2>

When processing an application specific request, the application's log
handler should be used. This can be accessed by calling the
{@link com.percussion.server.PSApplicationHandler#getLogHandler getLogHandler}
method of the appropriate PSApplicationHandler object. When in the context
of a data request processing component which has access to the
{@link com.percussion.data.PSExecutionData PSExecutionData} object,
its {@link com.percussion.data.PSExecutionData#getLogHandler getLogHandler}
method can be used instead.


<H2>Log Management - Behind the Scenes</H2>

<H3>Log Structure</H3>

The log will be stored in the same back-end data store as the object store.
See the {@link com.percussion.log.PSBackEndLogWriter PSBackEndLogWriter}
class for a description of the log record structure. A secondary mechanism
is also supported. If the back-end server is unavailable, the log can be
written to disk. See the
{@link com.percussion.log.PSFileLogWriter PSFileLogWriter} class for a
description of the file format.

<H3>Log Access</H3>

Having too many back-end connections open to the object store is clearly a
problem we can't afford to run into. The PSBackEndLogWriter class is defined
which provides serialized access to the log table. To avoid slowing down 
applications, they do not directly access the PSBackEndLogWriter object. The
PSLogManager class handles creating the PSBackEndLogWriter and
managing access to it. The PSLogManager object receives log requests
from the server and applications through objects extending the
PSLogInformation abstract class. It will add the object to its in-memory
queue, and apply them to the back-end. If the back-end server is down,
causing the in-memory queue to build up, the log messages will be written
to disk. This is done using the PSFileLogWriter class. The in-memory queue
is disabled at this point. Once the server is back up, the log messages will
be read back from disk (using the PSFileLogReader) and written to the
back-end. The in-memory queue will once again be enabled.
<p>
The server and each application may follow different logging rules. As such,
each has its own PSLogHandler object. This object is used to determine if
the specified type of action should be logged. It is also used to send
the log message to the back-end log. The server or application passes the
PSLogInformation sub-object to the PSLogManager, which does the
actual write to the log.
