<H2>E2 Hook - ISAPI Extension</H2>

The ISAPI Extension allows E2 to hook Microsoft IIS and Apache web servers.
Extensions are written as DLLs implementing three functions. These are:
<UL>
<LI>GetExtensionVersion - initialize the extension and return to IIS the
supported version info</LI>
<LI>HttpExtensionProc - this is the work horse, called for each request</LI>
<LI>TerminateExtension - shutdown the extension</LI>
</UL>

<P>When HttpExtensionProc is called, we first need to locate the E2 server
we will be communicating with. This could optionally be moved to the
GetExtensionVersion call, but that would prevent us from implementing a
load balancing model. Since we will want to support such a model in the
future, we may as well start with that logic here.</P>

<P>Once we know the E2 server we'll be sending the request to, we need to
open a connection to that server (if we don't have one cached). Reuse of
connections is important so we don't bog down the server. Once connected,
the client request data will be packaged as an HTTP request and sent to the
E2 server for processing. No pre-processing is done by the hook. The E2
request will be packaged as follows:</P>
<OL>
<LI>write the request line containing: lpECB-&gt;lpszMethod + " " + 
(lpECB-&gt;lpszPathTranslated ? lpECB-&gt;lpszPathTranslated : 
lpECB-&gt;lpszPathInfo) + " " + SERVER_PROTOCOL value 
(use lpECB-&gt;GetServerVariable)</LI>
<LI>write the header line(s) using lpECB-&gt;GetServerVariable(ALL_RAW)</LI>
<LI>write the body of the request using lpECB-&gt;lpbData
and lpECB-&gt;ReadClient() (if needed)</LI>
</OL>

<P>The hook will now wait for a response from the E2 server. Once the
response is received, it will be packaged and sent back to the requestor.
This is done by sending a properly formed response message. E2 sends
the appropriate response message to the hook, which can in turn send
it's output directly to the client using the lpECB-&gt;WriteClient()
call.</P>
