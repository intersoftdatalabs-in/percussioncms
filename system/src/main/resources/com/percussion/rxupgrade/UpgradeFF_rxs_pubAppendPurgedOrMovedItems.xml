      <initParam name="com.percussion.user.description">The objectives of this extension are to filter the content list for
publishing by appending the content items/pages that were published earlier
and are:

1. Purged from the system
2. Removed from a folder
3. Moved from one folder to another

to the unpublish content list XML result document. It uses the following
algorithm to do the above:

1. Gets all previously published items/pages to the site by making an
internal request to a Rhythmyx resource. These are obtained as a result set
for performance reasons.
2. Gets the parent folderids for each of the items. While doing so, it
assumes the item can exist in multiple folders.
3. It generates publish paths for each of the folders it exists in.
4. It filters out any item with publish path not matching with the
previously published location path.
5. It builds the content list document for these remaining items/pages by
making another internal request to a Rhythmyx resource.
6. Finally, this list is merged with the result document which is already
an unpublish content list document.

The exit takes one optional parameter to indicate if the publish path
comparison should be case sensitive. The default value for this is "no". It
assumes the DTD of the result document to be contentlist.dtd and
the content list being generated is for unpublishing.</initParam>
