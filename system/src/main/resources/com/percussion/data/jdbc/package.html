<BODY>

E2 implements JDBC drivers for any non-JDBC data stores it wants to access
as SQL data stores. E2 does not implement fully JDBC compliant drivers. This
is primarily for speed of development as we do not need the entire JDBC
functionality set.

<H2>Implementation Phases</H2>
<B>Phase I:</B>
<UL>
<LI>ODBC IPSDriverMetaData support</LI>
<LI>File System JDBC Driver with catalog only support (for XML)</LI>
</UL>
<B>Phase III:</B>
<UL>
<LI>File System JDBC Driver with transaction support (for XML)</LI>
<LI>Full XML JDBC Driver (extends File Systen JDBC driver)</LI>
</UL>
