<BODY>

This specification describes the internal classes which are used by the E2
server as well as the XML/HTML model used to send and receive catalog
requests from external applications (such as browsers and the E2 designer).
The Cataloger provides metadata about the various components E2 supports.
The request categories supported for cataloging are:</P>

<UL>
<LI>data - provides metadata about back-end drivers, tables, etc. </LI>
<LI>exit - provides metadata about the installed exit handlers </LI>
<LI>mail - provides metadata about the installed mail providers </LI>
<LI>security - provides metadata about the installed security providers </LI>
<LI>xml - provides metadata about the internal XML documents the E2 server
    utilizes</LI>
</UL>

<H2>Implementation Phases</H2>

<P>For phase I, basic catalog support will be provided, with the following
limits:</P>

<UL>
<LI>cataloging will not support looking up pre-defined metadata from the
    object store</LI>
</UL>

<P>For version 1.0 release, the following will be added:</P>

<UL>
<LI>cataloger will search the object store</LI>
</UL>

<H2>Client - Server Interfaces</H2>
<P>The client performs catalog requests through the E2 server. Let's define
the interface between the client and server. Catalog requests will usually be
performed by the E2 designer. To access the cataloger, the requestor must be
logged in and have design access to the E2 server.</P>

<H3>Request URL</H3>
<P>The E2 server may be accessed through a hook mechanism, such as ISAPI
filters or it may be accessed as a resource, such as ISAPI extensions.
ISAPI filters use the following syntax:</P>
<PRE><CODE>
   protocol://host/E2Root/E2Design
</CODE></PRE>

ISAPI extensions use the following syntax:

<PRE><CODE>
   protocol://host/E2Root/E2Executable
</CODE></PRE>

<P>The components are defined as follows:</P>

<UL>
<LI>protocol - several protocols have been defined for communicating with
    web servers. The most common protocol is the HyperText Transfer
	Protocol (HTTP). To provide secure transmissions over HTTP, Secure HTTP
	(HTTPS) is used. HTTPS uses SSL to encrypt all outgoing data and decrypt
	all incoming data.</LI>
<LI>host - the Internet host domain name or IP address of the web server.
    For example, Percussion's Internet host domain name is www.percussion.com
	and it's IP address is 38.227.11.4.</LI>
<LI>E2Root - the root directory for E2 (usually where it's installed)</LI>
<LI>E2Design - this is a magic directory name E2 reacts to. For the
    production release, we'll want to use RealProductNameDesign in lieu of
	E2Design.</LI>
<LI>E2Executable - the name of the E2 executable module. For instance, the
    ISAPI Extension name may be psxisapie.dll</LI></UL>

<H3>Request Header</H3>

<P>The special E2 request header, PS-Request-Type, must be set when
performing catalog requests. The request type is one of the following:</P>
<UL>
<LI>design-catalog-data - data store catalog information is being
    requested</LI>
<LI>design-catalog-exit - exit handler catalog information is being
    requested</LI>
<LI>design-catalog-mail - mail provider catalog information is being
    requested</LI>
<LI>design-catalog-security - security provider catalog information is being
    requested</LI>
<LI>design-catalog-xml - internal xml catalog information is being
    requested</LI>
</UL>

<H3>Request Body</H3>

<P>Along with the URL, a request body is needed. This is done by performing a
POST request. GET is not supported for cataloging. The body uses the 
<CODE>text/xml</CODE> MIME type and contains the raw XML data for the request.
A sample catalog request to get the ODBC server names is as follows:</P>

<PRE><CODE>
   Content-Type: text/xml

   &lt;?xml version="1.0" standalone="yes"?&gt;
   &lt;PSXServerCatalog&gt;
      &lt;driverName&gt;ODBC&lt;/driverName&gt;
   &lt;/PSXServerCatalog&gt;
</CODE></PRE>

<P>The XML descriptions of the various catalog requests are explained in
their corresponding Java interfaces. In particular, a CatalogHandler is
defined for each type of catalog request. To see the format of the XML
request, review the corresponding catalog handler's documentation.
Knowledge of the XML format is not required by clients as this is dealt
with by the catalog handler. The supported request types, and their
corresponding handlers are:</P>

<H2>Java Interface</H2>

<P>The Java interface to the cataloger is what will be used by the designer
clients, such as the Visual Workbench. The request will be received by the
E2 server and passed on to the appropriate manager, based upon the request
category. These are:</P>
