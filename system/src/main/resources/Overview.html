<BODY>
   This document describes the classes defined by the E2 server. Most classes
   are used internally by the server. This includes the server core, log
   management, error management, data handling and exit handling.
   <p>
   External APIs are also provided. These classes are used by remote clients,
   to access the server, define applications on it, etc. The main external
   interfaces are the object store, cataloger and administration client.
   At this time, only Percussion tools such as the Designer client should
   actually use these APIs. Furthermore, they should not be provided for
   public consumption (eg, documented, etc.).
   <p>
   For more information on the server and its components, review the
   package summaries listed above.
