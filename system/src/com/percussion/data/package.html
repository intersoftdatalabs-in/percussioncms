<BODY>

This specification defines the data management model used by E2.
Only the internal classes used by the E2 server are defined in this
specification. The interface to these is defined in the object store.

<H2>Implementation Phases</H2>
<B>Phase I:</B>
<UL>
<LI>Data request handler (determines request type, calls appropriate
    handlers)</LI>
<LI>Query handler</LI>
<LI>Simple query optimizer (no join support, etc.)</LI>
<LI>NO update support</LI>
<LI>"Dumb" database pool (opens connection for each request)</LI>
<LI>Full ODBC support (through JDBC driver)</LI>
<LI>File System JDBC Driver with catalog only support (for XML)</LI>
</UL>
<B>Phase II:</B>
<UL>
<LI>Full query optimizer</LI>
<LI>Data joiner (heterogeneous result sets)</LI>
<LI>Single table update support</LI>
<LI>True database pooling</LI>
</UL>
<B>Phase III:</B>
<UL>
<LI>Query caching</LI>
<LI>File System JDBC Driver with transaction support (for XML)</LI>
<LI>Full XML JDBC Driver (extends File Systen JDBC driver)</LI>
</UL>
<B>Version 1.0:</B>
<UL>
<LI>Result paging</LI>
<LI>Multi table update support</LI>
</UL>

<H2>Data Providers (Drivers)</H2>

One of the key features of E2 is its ability to access data. To simplify
the internal model, all data access will occur through JDBC. Certain drivers
we want to support are not available as JDBC drivers. We must implement
JDBC conformant drivers for these. One feature we'd like to support is the
cataloging of servers available through a driver. JDBC does not provide a
mechanism for this. For our internal drivers, we will add an interface
which the driver may choose to implement. This interface is called 
IPSDriverMetaData and currently supports locating server names only.
Aside from this limitation, using the JDBC model greatly simplifies our
internal data model, which is why it has been chosen. The data providers
we will support are:
<table border="2">
  <tr><th>Driver</th><th>Extends</th></tr>
  <tr><td>JDBC</td><td></th></tr>
  <tr><td>ODBC</td><td>*uses sun.jdbc.odbc.JdbcOdbcDriver</th></tr>
  <tr><td>File System</td><td></th></tr>
  <tr><td>XML</td><td>File System</th></tr>
</table>
Many database vendors have ported their client APIs to Java, implementing
JDBC drivers. These include:
<UL>
<LI>IBM DB2 - requires DB2 CLI</LI>
<LI>Oracle - SQL*Net or 100% pure Java supported</LI>
</UL>
