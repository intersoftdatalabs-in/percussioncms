<BODY>

This package contains the connectivity layer for E2. It contains classes
for use by clients, such as the E2 designer as well as server classes for
communicating.

<p>

The connectivity will initially be written to utilize TCP sockets. We may
expand this to use IPC mechanisms (eg, shared memory) to speed up
interaction between the hook and the server.
