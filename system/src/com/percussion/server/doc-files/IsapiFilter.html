<H2>E2 Hook - ISAPI Filter</H2>

The ISAPI Filter allows E2 to directly hook the Microsoft IIS core. Filters
are called by the server at the various points in the request process.
Fitlers are written as DLLs implementing three functions. These are:
<UL>
<LI><CODE>GetFilterVersion</CODE> - initialize the filter and return to IIS
the supported version info and the desired events to hook. This is called
once when the server starts.</LI>
<LI><CODE>HttpFilterProc</CODE> - this is the work horse, called for each
request</LI>
<LI><CODE>TerminateFilter</CODE> - shutdown the filter. This is called
once when the server is shut down.</LI>
</UL>

<P>Unlike ISAPI extensions, filters must be performance conscious above all
else. Every request going through the web server is intercepted by the
filter. Extensions are called only when the request is for the extension,
which is why performance is not as critical.<P>

<P>To provide the required through put, we must make the request detection
process as quick as possible. Several settings can be defined on the E2
server to assist in this process. By trapping just the header pre-processing
event (<CODE>SF_NOTIFY_PREPROC_HEADERS</CODE>) we can minimize our impact
and still detect E2 requests fairly reliably. During pre-processing we also
have the opportunity to redirect the request. We will actually re-direct the
request to our ISAPI Extension, allowing the filter to contain no code
which is dependent upon the E2 server's request processing.</P>

<P>The first thing the hook does is check for the existence of the E2
specific request header <CODE>PS-Reqeust-Type</CODE>. If this exists, the
request is clearly for E2 and in a format E2 understands. This request is
then handed to our ISAPI extension, as described below.</P>

<P>Next, the more complex task of detecting a data request begins. The
E2 server request root is the first piece of information we need to check.
This contains the root "directory" for E2 requests.
If the request URL does not begin with this, the filter will ignore the
request. If it does begin with the appropriate root, the application
request roots are then checked. The application request root is treated
as the next part of the URL. If this matches one of the applications
defined in E2, the request page is checked next. This is the final part of
the URL and matches the page supported by one or more data sets in the
application. If a match is found here, the request is definitely for E2.</P>

<P>As noted earlier, we don't actually send the request to E2, we redirect
it to our ISAPI extension. To do this, we simply call <CODE>SetHeader</CODE>
(in the <CODE>PHTTP_FILTER_PREPROC_HEADERS</CODE> object) to set the
following headers:</P>

<UL><CODE>
<LI>URL: /{E2 ISAPI Extension}?psrequrl={original URL}{&original params}</LI>
<LI>PS-Request-Version: 1.0</LI>
<LI>PS-Request-Type: {appropriate type}</LI>
<LI>PS-Application: {application name}</LI>
<LI>PS-DataSet: {data set name}</LI>
</CODE></UL>

<P>When IIS performs its URL resolution, it will call our
<A HREF="IsapiExtension.html">ISAPI Extension</A> to complete the
request.</P>

<H2>Implementation Details</H2>

<P>When <CODE>GetFilterVersion</CODE> is called to initialize the filter,
we will check if our local E2 server is up. If it's not, we will start it.
We'll then load the E2 server request root, application request roots and
the application request pages. We'll also register a listener for changes
to these components. These pieces will be loaded into memory and stored
using the following structures:</P>

<PRE><CODE>
   typedef struct tagE2HookBlock_Page {
      char *            szName;        /* the name of the request page */
      char *            szDataSet;     /* the name of the data set handling
                                        * requests for this page
                                        */
   } E2HookBlock_Page, *PE2HookBlock_Page;

   typedef struct tagE2HookBlock_App {
      char *            szName;        /* the name of the app */
      char *            szRoot;        /* the request root for the app */
      PE2HookBlock_Page aPages[];      /* the sorted array of request
                                        * pages associated with this app
                                        */
      ULONG             ulPageCount;   /* the number of request pages
                                        * in the array
                                        */
      ULONG             ulPageMax;     /* the array capacity */
   } E2HookBlock_App, *PE2HookBlock_App;

   typedef struct tagE2HookBlock_Server {
      char *            szName;        /* the name of the server */
      char *            szRoot;        /* the request root for the server */
      PE2HookBlock_App  aApps[];       /* the sorted array of apps
                                        * defined on this server
                                        */
      ULONG             ulAppCount;    /* the number of apps in the array */
      ULONG             ulAppMax;      /* the array capacity */
   } E2HookBlock_Server, *PE2HookBlock_Server;
</CODE></PRE>

<P>For each E2 server supported, a <code>PE2HookBlock_Server</code> object
exists. Within each server block, it contains a sorted array of the
applications that exist on the server. Each application contains a
sorted array of the request pages that are used by the application.</P>

<P>Access to the memory will be protected using a mutex semaphore. This
has the adverse effect of serializing access to the memory across all
threads. However, since the memory is sorted we will be doing binary 
searches. This should make the required access time very small.</P>

<P>The longest delay will be when multiple changes are detected. The
server hook listener will need to insert elements or remove elements from
the appropriate places in the chain. This may require array reallocation,
which can take some time, but overall it should not be too bad.</P>
