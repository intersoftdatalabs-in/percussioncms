<BODY>

The IPC package provides access to the inter-process communication
primitives of the underlying OS. Java does not have support for IPC, thus
the need for us to develop our own IPC classes using native method support.
Our native library is identical to the Java library, but it is written in
C++.

IPC is primarily used to allow the E2 server to communicate efficiently
with the web server hooks (eg, ISAPI filter). When E2 resides on a 
separate server than the web server, TCP/IP sockets are used for
communication. The use of sockets on the web server can be a burden as each
client opens a socket to the web server. The web server hands the request to
the E2 hook which then opens a socket to the E2 server. This means for each
request two sockets are maintained. Since there is a limit on the number of
open sockets, the use of E2 on a web server effectively cuts the maximum 
number of users possible in half.

Let's take a look at the IPC primitives we will use in E2.

<H3>Shared Memory</H3>
Shared memory is a piece of memory which can be accessed by multiple
processes on the same system. The users of the shared memory must agree
upon its structure as well as the access mechanisms to guarantee its
integrity. In particular, processes/threads should not read from areas
of the shared memory that are being written by other processes/threads.

<H3>Mutex Semaphore</H3>
A mutex semaphore is one way to synchronize shared memory. Mutex
stands for mutual exclusion. When a thread or process wants access to a 
piece of shared memory, it must first acquire the mutex. The mutex only
permits a single thread or process to acquire it at any given time. This
guarantees serial access to the area of shared memory. When a user is done
with the shared memory, they must then release the mutex to allow others
access to it. It is important to minimize the amount of time spend holding
the mutex lock. The longer the lock is held, the longer other threads and
processes must wait. Furthermore, caution must be used when acquiring
multiple mutex locks. It is possible to get into deadlock conditions, in
which case no one can access the resource as the holder of one mutex is
trying to get the other mutex and vice versa.

<H3>Event Semaphore</H3>
The final mechanism we will implement is the event semaphore. Event
semaphores provide a way for producers to signal a consumers that they've
created something the consumer is interested in. Unlike a mutex, event
semaphores act like counters rather than locks. When a producer signals the
semaphore the count goes up. The consumer wakes up whenever the count is
greater than 0. Once all the produce is consumed, the count goes back down
to 0 and the consumer must wait until a producer signals him.
<P>
The primary use of event semaphores within E2 is for the hook process
(eg, ISAPI filter) to signal the E2 server when an incoming request has
been added to the shared memory.

<H2>Using IPC in E2</H2>

When the E2 server starts up, it will create a named shared memory area,
which we'll call "E2CTLSHM". This area will contain the control area
defining how the E2 server is setup. It will also create a mutex to control
access to the shared memory block, which we'll call "E2CTLMTX". These will
then be wrapped up into the
<A href="../server/PSSharedMemoryControlBlock.html">PSSharedMemoryControlBlock</A>
object which provides simplified access to the shared memory. The structre
of the control block is defined in the
<A href="../server/PSSharedMemoryControlBlock.html">PSSharedMemoryControlBlock</A>
class.

<P>
To access the shared memory, a process such as our ISAPI filter must
gain access to the named shared memory and the named mutex. Once both
pieces have been acquired, the process must define a global variable to
store the PSSharedMemoryControlBlock object (the shared control block).

<P>
Checking the value of shmApplication should be done while holding the
mutex. Once that's done, the mutex can be release. As you may have realized,
access to the application area is not protected. This does not pose a 
problem. When the server wants to change the settings for an application,
it will create a new shared memory block then update shmApplications with
the new handler. It will then release the lock on the control structure.
Any subsequent readers will see that shmApplications changed and will 
map to the new memory area. Anyone in the application prior to the server
making the changes will see the old data. This is not a problem. They will
take an action based upon the setting, just as they would have should they
have held the mutex. When the server processes the request it will use the
latest copy of its data, in which case it will fail the request if
information has changed (such as the application going down). Once again,
this behavior is no different than if we serialized the memory, but we
achieve gains in performance. The structure of the application shared
memory area is defined in the
<A href="../server/PSSharedMemoryApplications.html">PSSharedMemoryApplications</A>
class.

<P>
Once the producer (ISAPI filter) wants to place an event in the server's
request queue, it will create a 
<A href="../server/PSSharedMemoryHttpRequestEvent.html">PSSharedMemoryHttpRequestEvent</A>
object. It must then call the PSSharedMemoryControlBlock.postEvent method
to add the event to the server's request queue.
