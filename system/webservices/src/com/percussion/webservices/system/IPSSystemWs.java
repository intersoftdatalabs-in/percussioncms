/**
 * This interface defines all system related webservices.
 * <p>
 * The relationship methods in this interface are made public for advanced uses
 * only (and the relationships should be used read-only, the
 * {@link #saveRelationships(List)} method must be used w/ special care.)
 * Generally, there are specific methods for each relationship type that should
 * be used for creating/editing each type of relationship that can be found in
 * the {@link IPSContentWs} interface. 
 * <p>
 * If the implementer has created a new relationship type that has properties
 * beyond those supported by the standard interfaces, then these methods may
 * prove useful. 
 * <p>
 * The following table shows the preferred create methods for each type of 
 * relationship:
 * <table>
 *   <th>
 *      <td>Relationship category</td><td>Method</td>
 *   </th>
 *   <tr>
 *      <td>Active Assembly</td>
